Description: Linux Virtual Server support programs
 The Linux Virtual Server is a highly scalable and highly available server
 built on a cluster of real servers. The architecture of the cluster is
 transparent to end users, and the users see only a single virtual server.
 .
 This package provides some support programs necessary to implement a virtual
 server under Linux. With the addition of the mon and heartbeat packages it is
 possible to implement a complete high-availability solution for Linux.
